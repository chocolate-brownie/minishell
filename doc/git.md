# Understanding the Integration Workflow for First-Time Team Projects

This guide explains how your code and your teammate's code come together using the branch structure for collaborative development.

## The Big Picture

Think of each branch as a separate workspace:
- **parsing branch**: Your personal workspace where you develop the parser
- **execution branch**: Your teammate's workspace for execution components
- **dev branch**: The integration area where both parts come together
- **main branch**: The final, stable version of your project

## How Code Integration Works Step-by-Step

### 1. Independent Development
Both you and your teammate work separately:

```bash
# You (on parsing branch)
git checkout parsing
# Make changes to parsing files
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement tokenizer"
git push origin parsing

# Meanwhile, your teammate (on execution branch)
git checkout execution
# Makes changes to execution files
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement execve wrapper"
git push origin execution
```

### 2. Integration Point (When Features are Ready)

When either of you completes a feature that should be integrated:

```bash
# You decide to integrate your parsing feature
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev  # Get latest dev version
git merge parsing    # Bring your changes into dev
# Test that everything still works
git push origin dev  # Update the shared dev branch
```

Your teammate would follow the same process with their execution branch.

### 3. Keeping In Sync

After integration, both of you should update your feature branches:

```bash
# You
git checkout parsing
git pull origin dev  # Get the integrated code including your teammate's work

# Your teammate
git checkout execution
git pull origin dev  # Get the integrated code including your work
```

## Practical Example Timeline

Let's see how this might look over a few days:

**Day 1:**
- You both start with the same structure
- You work on parsing, create files, push to parsing branch
- Your teammate works on execution, creates files, pushes to execution branch

**Day 3:**
- You've completed the basic tokenizer
- You merge parsing → dev to make it available
- You notify your teammate: "I've integrated the tokenizer into dev"

**Day 4:**
- Your teammate completes command execution
- They merge execution → dev
- They message you: "I've integrated command execution into dev"
- You both pull from dev to get each other's work

**Day 5:**
- You both continue working on your branches with knowledge of each other's code
- The integration in dev lets you test how your parts work together

## Key Things to Remember

1. **Push to your own branch frequently**:
   - This creates checkpoints of your work
   - Makes your progress visible to your teammate

2. **Merge to dev only when**:
   - A feature is complete enough to be useful
   - Your code compiles and runs without errors
   - You're ready for your teammate to use your code

3. **Pull from dev regularly**:
   - This keeps you updated with your teammate's latest integrated work
   - Prevents you from getting too far out of sync

4. **Communicate about integration**:
   - "I'm about to merge my parsing changes to dev"
   - "I've updated dev with the command executor"

## Common Git Commands Reference

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Check status of files
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new-branch-name

# Switch to existing branch
git checkout branch-name
```

### Collaboration Commands
```bash
# Get latest changes from remote
git pull origin branch-name

# Upload your changes to remote
git push origin branch-name

# Merge another branch into current branch
git merge other-branch-name

# View differences
git diff
```

### Conflict Resolution
```bash
# When merge conflicts occur:
# 1. Edit files to resolve conflicts
# 2. Add resolved files
git add resolved-file.c

# 3. Complete the merge
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts in X functionality"
```
